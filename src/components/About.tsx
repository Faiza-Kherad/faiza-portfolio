        Hi there! I'm a web developer with a passion for building websites that are both functional and visually appealing. 
        My skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I'm currently diving into Next.js and UI design 
        to take my projects to the next level.
        <br /><br />
        Beyond coding, I have a strong interest in reading science-related books and exploring the world of mathematics. 
        These interests fuel my curiosity and inspire me to approach problems with a logical and creative mindset.
        <br /><br />
        Iâ€™m always excited to learn new things and apply them to my work, whether it's a personal project or a collaborative effort. 
        I'm driven by the challenge of creating seamless user experiences and bringing ideas to life through code.
      </p>
